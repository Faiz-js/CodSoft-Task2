        <h1>About Me</h1><br>
        I become very much passionate about coding at the age of sixteen
        years old. The questions like "How a web browser works?", "How a website gets develop?" started
        making me curious about web development and thats when I started my journey.<br><br>
        I learnt HTML and CSS which took me 1 month to learn it then I started making clone websites using them which
        took me 2 months to completely master HTML and CSS.<br><br>
        Then I began to learn Javascript which was first a bit difficult for me but as I kept on trying it things got
        simpler and easier. Learning Javascript took me 2 months. Then I began doing small projects with HTML, CSS and
        Javascript for another 2 months.<br><br>
        Then I started to learn Backend. I learnt about NodeJS, ExpressJS and database like MongoDB, after these I began
        to learn aboout Frontend with a popular library ReactJS<br><br>
        After all these I began my projects using all these technologies and did some internships.
